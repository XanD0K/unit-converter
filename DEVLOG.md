## [2025-09-23] - Version 0.9.14
**Plans**
- Implement test files to test all functions and methods in my program

**Challenges**
- Understand how to properly manage classess and user's input in a test file, especially by using `mock` and `patch` from `unittest` module and how to create `fixture` from `pytest` library

**Progress**
- Created `test_utils.py` file to test functions in `utils.py`
- Created `test_data_manager.py` file to test functions on `data_manager.py`. Skipped `validate_data`, `add_to_log`, `clean_history` and `save_data` functions due to their complexity, leaving as TODO's as a post-course activity
- Created `test_data_models.py` file to test all methods of all classes in `data_models.py`, except `DataStore` class which is just a data class
- Created `test_api.py` file to test `Converter` class methods
- Created `test_project.py` file to test all functions on my `project.py` file, which is the core file of my program. It was easier since I already had all tests for almost all functions in taht file from previous test files that were already being implemented


## [2025-09-19] - Version 0.9.10
**Plans**
- Prevent users to enter invalid number of positional arguments and key-word arguments

**Progress**
- Created `validate_args_number` in `data_models.py` to check and validate excessive arguments (`*args` and `**kwargs`), updating all methods in `Converter` class to accept `*args` and `**kwargs` arguments, allowing to catch `TypeError` in situations where user inputs more arguments than required

## [2025-09-17] - Version 0.9.8
**Plans**
- Fix `refactor_value` function used in "change-base" action

**Challenges**
- Refactoring was always leading to repeating decimals

**Progress**
- First approach was a manual refactoring, but "change-base" action was leading to repeating decimals, losing precision over multiple and sequencial triggers. I also tried to use `fractions` module to round repeating decimals when refactoring, but it was getting overkill. My final approach was to create `original_units.json` file
- Created `original_units.json` file to keep track of original conversion factors. Used by `refactor_value` function, instead of using `units.json` file, which keeps track of most recent value. It allowed to keep precision while avoided repeating decimals


## [2025-09-15] - Version 0.9.6
**Plans**
- Allow user to declare an object class, so that he can use the program through API, besides current CLI and interactive mode

**Progress**
- Created `api.py` file with an `Converter` class, and used existed functions to develop that class, creating different methods for every action
- Changed `Convert` class methods, to also receive a `print_message` argument, set as `False` by default, which will controls the output message display
- Added aliases for all methods in `Convert` class
- Changed `Converter` methods in `api.py` file so that it takes user's input as a single argument, and I strip it, instead of passing multiple arguments to the function, making codebase cleaner


## [2025-09-14] - Version 0.9.5
**Plans**
- Segregate `ConversionData` class into multiple classes, since that class had almost 300 lines
- Allow user to quit anytime he wants

**Progress**
- Segregated `UnitData` class into `ConversionData`, `ManageTypeData`, `AliasesData` and `ChangeBaseData` classes
- Created `get_users_input` function to be used instead of Python's `input` function. It allows users to quit anytime they want, by checking for 'quit' input


## [2025-09-11] - Version 0.9.2
**Plans**
- Cleaning codebase and centralizing similar data

**Progress**
- Created an `UnitData` class to hold all that related to units, including `unit_group`, `from_type`, `to_type`, `amount`, `new_value`, `time_input`, `from_time`, `to_time`, `factor_time`, `new_time`, `action, value`, `alias`, `factor` and `offset` variables
- Centralized all variable's validations in `UnitData` class, cleaning `project.py`


## [2025-09-10] - Version 0.9.1
**Plans**
- Create data class so that all `.json` files can be user throughout all files

**Challenges**
- I first thought to use variables that make reference to `.json` files as global variables, importing throughtout all files. The code was getting too overkill, with every change leading to a new one. I then decided to use a class to handle that, making cove cleaner and reusable

**Progress**
- Created `ConversionData` data class to store all data from `.json` files


## [2025-09-09] - Version 0.9.0
**Plans**
- Segregate `project.py` file, which was the core of the program, into multiple files. It already had almost 1000 lines of code

**Challenges**
- Segregating `project.py` into multiple files, raised errors about variables, specially global variables realated to ".json" files. Decided do go with a "data class", for easy access and passing around multiple functions and files

**Progress**
- Created `unit_converter` directory to store all functions from `project.py`: `utils.py` containing all helper functions and `data_manager_.py` with all functions that acess, modify and save data in any `.json` file
- Moved all `.json` files into a new `data` directory


## [2025-09-07] - Version 0.8.2
**Plans**
- Continue improving time conversion logic, cleaning and polishing codebase

**Challenges**
- I had already created 3 `.json` files to help with time conversion
- To deal with new `month_days.json` file, I needed to learn how `next` and `iter` work

**Progress**
- Merged `month_index_days.json` and `month_indexes.json` files into `month_days.json`, creating a nested dictionary file with all info needed


## [2025-09-05] - Version 0.8.0
**Plans**
-Continue improving time conversion, cleaning code, improving user's UX

**Challenges**
- Every time format required a different logic (and consequently a different function to handle that logic)
- Needed to search and think a lot about how mathematical logic to calculate leap years works

**Progress**
- Improved regex in `parse_date_input` function
- Createad `get_seconds`, `calculate_leap_years` and `validate_date` helpers functions to imrpove time conversions
- Created `month_index_days.json` and `month_indexes.json` file to help dealing with month's index and the number of days in that respective month


## [2025-09-03] - Version 0.7.0
**Plans**
- Add aliases to all actions to improve UX
- Decided to remove `while` loops that kept user inside each input, keeping only the `while` loop in `get_action`, so user can trigger multiple acctions in a single session

**Challenges**
- `argparse` module doesn't have a direct interaction between argument's name and argument's aliases. I can't just check for its name. I also need to check for its aliases

**Progress**
- Created `unit_alises.json` file, that contain all aliases for each unit_type. Also created `manage_aliases` function that allows users to add and remove aliases from that file
- Created `resolve_aliases` function to get user's input, either the full unit name or its alias, and outputs its respective name
- Changed `handle_cli` to also allow aliases manipulation through CLI


## [2025-09-01] - Version 0.6.0
**Plans**
- Allow users to input multiple time unit formats

**Challenges**
- Deal with multiple formats means deal with different users inputs
- Had to learn the basics of `datetime` library

**Progress**
- Created `days_to_month.json` file to strore a relationship between month's name and the number of days on that month
- Created `converter_time` function to handle multiple formats for time conversion (e.g. seconds minutes 10, 17:28:36 04:15:22 seconds, JAN NOV minutes, 2019-11-04 2056-04-28 days)
- Created `parse_time_input`, `check_time_is_none` and `parse_date_input` helper functions that use `re` and `datetime` modules to assist on time conversion
- Changed `add_to_log` function to also accept multiple time formats
- Changed `print_history` function to print different messages based on conversion time format
- Changed `handle_cli` function to also accept multiple formats for time conversion


## [2025-08-31] - Version 0.5.0
**Plans**
- Allow users to see previous conversions

**Progress**
- Created `conversion_log.json` file to keep track of all past conversions user has made
- Created `add_to_log` function to add successfull conversions to that new `conversion_log.json` file
- Created `history` command, so user can access and print previous conversions


## [2025-08-29] - Version 0.4.0
**Plans**
- Keep current interactive mode, and also allow users to access the program through command-line arguments
- Allow users to trigger an action in CLI with aliases, keeping code less verbose

**Challenges**
- Handle `argparse` module and how to configure command-line arguments
- "add" action was more complex to implement in CLI

**Progress**
- Created `base_units.json` file to keep track of base units for every unit group
- Created `validate_dictionaries` function to validate both `.json` files before opening and accessing them
- Created `handle_cli` function to deal with all CLI logic


## [2025-08-28] - Version 0.3.0
**Plans**
- Make code cleaner by creating multiple functions, one for each action

**Challenges**
- Temperature units needed an improved logic
- All my conversion outputs were bad formatted, without punctuations and with trailling zeroes

**Progress**
- Removed actions from `main`, and created specific functions to deal with each action: `add_logic`, `add_new_group` and `conversion_logic`
- To handle temperature units, I also created `converter_temp` to conver temperature units, and `add_temp_logic` to add temperature unit types
- Created `format_value` function to handle trailling zeroes


## [2025-08-27] - Version 0.2.0
**Plans**
- Improve program by handling exceptions and keeping user inside of it
- Segregate files, improving user's UX and making `project.py` file cleaner
- Create multiple actions

**Progress**
- Created introductory messages with instructions
- Implemented and infinite loop to keep user inside the program, until he decides do quit it
- Moved `units` dictionary to `units.json` file, keeping `project.py` cleaner
- Removed `try-except` blocks from all functions, centralizing errors handling in `main`
- Created multiple actions in `main`, allowing users not only to convert values, but to print all unit groups, print all unit types for a specific group and add unit types.


## [2025-08-26] - Version 0.1.0
**Plans**
- Implement the first functional structure for a converter program, starting with the basics and incrementing it gradually

**Challenges**
- Trying to figure out what to do, and how to accomplish it

**Progress**
- Create a `units` dictionary, with all unit groups and unit types, and their respective values based on Internation System of Units (SI)
- Implemented the core logic with `get_amount`, `get_unit_group` `get_converter_unit` and `converter` functions
